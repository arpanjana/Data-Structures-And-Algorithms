Iterators
Iterators as an entity that helps us to access the data within a container with certain restrictions.

1. Input Iterators:
A entity through which you can read data from container and move ahead. For example - A keyboard

2. Output Iterators:
An entity through which you can write into the container and move ahead.

3. Forward Iterators:
Iterators with functionalitites of input and output iteraotr in single direction. For example- Single Linked List
 
4. Bidirectional Iterators
An iterator that can move in both directions.

5. Random Acess Iterators
Random Access Iterators is an iterator that can read/write in both directions and also can take jumps.


Why Learn Iterators?
We want to make generic algorithms with freedom from underlying data structures.

Example-
We made search() function to work on all the data-types using templates.
Now we can make search() function to work on all types of container using iterators.
